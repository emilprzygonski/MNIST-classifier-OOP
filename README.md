# MNIST classifier

In this task I was supposed to build a DigitClassifier model that takes an algorithm as an input parameter. Possible values for the algorithm are: cnn, rf, rand for the three models
described above.

The solution contains:
- Interface for models like Convolutional Neural Network, Random Forest classifier,
Random model. Potentially other developers will develop new models, so we
need to have an interface for them. Letâ€™s call it DigitClassificationInterface.
- 3 classes (1 for each model) that implement DigitClassificationInterface.
- DigitClassifier, which takes as an input parameter the name of the algorithm
and provides predictions with exactly the same structure (inputs and outputs) not
depending on the selected algorithm.
